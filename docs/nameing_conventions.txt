Naming convention for class and test script file name
=====================================================

I would like to request the following naming convention for classes and filename
regarding the new framework, rhtest.

1. filename of the testcase and the add_test(class_name) should match. 

2. use CamelCase for class names.  I would like to add the expectation that only 
   uppercase the first letter after the underscore (to make parsing easier) even 
   for names
   ex. 
3. use underscores as spaces in filenames or use the main test class name as the 
   filename.
    ex: for rhc_domain.py  the main class name should be RhcDomain, or you can 
    rename the file name to RhcDomain.py to match what is represented in the code. 

For example:

file_name                                       class_name
============================================================
qpid_binding.py                             QpidBinding
public_tcp_proxy.py                         PublicTcpProxy
embed_jenkins2scalable_app.py               EmbedJenkins2scalableApp

  The reason for this naming convention is to ensure that the framework can 
  dynamically add tests based on tags.  But please do keep these rules in mind when 
  adding new tests.
